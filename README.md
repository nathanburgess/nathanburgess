- âš¡ &nbsp; Fun facts:
  - I served six years as a Cryptolinguist in the USAF.
  - I developed and maintained an enterprise-scale, near-real-time data analytics service in PHP and jQuery back in 2010 for the NSA that was used by over 5,000 deployed troops and commanders. The platform helped track IEDs and other militant activity that allowed mission planning to prefer routes with less chances for coalition casualties.
  - I founded and run a small gaming community with around ~200 active members.
  - I was the CTO of a political technology startup for 3 years.
